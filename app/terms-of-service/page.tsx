                acknowledges and accepts these terms. Service availability,
                pricing, and estimated departure/arrival times are subject to
                change due to road conditions, operational constraints, and
                force majeure factors.

              <p>
                Passengers using shared services may carry luggage not exceeding
                20kg (max dimensions: 30&quot; x 22&quot; x 15&quot;). KTL is
                primarily a passenger transport company and not a logistics
                provider.
              </p>
              <h3 className="font-semibold">Excess Luggage</h3>
              <p>
                Passengers with excess luggage must notify KTL at booking.
                Charges may apply for extra seats or separate transportation.
              </p>
              <h3 className="font-semibold">Packing Standards</h3>
              <p>
                KTL is not responsible for damage resulting from poor or
                improper packaging. Clients must carry fragile items personally
                and avoid placing breakables in the luggage hold.
              </p>
              <h3 className="font-semibold">Banned & Regulated Items</h3>
              <p>
                Transporting illegal, banned, or hazardous items (e.g., gas
                cylinders, explosives, chemicals) is strictly prohibited. KTL
                will report any violations to the relevant authorities.
              </p>
              <h3 className="font-semibold">Luggage Identification</h3>
              <p>
                Each piece of luggage must be properly labeled with the
                owner&apos;s name and contact information. KTL is not liable for
                unmarked or misidentified property. Unclaimed items will be held
                for 30 days before disposal.
